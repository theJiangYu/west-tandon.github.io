I am a faculty member in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Tandon School of Engineering of New York University. I received a Diplom degree from the Technical University of Braunschweig in Germany, and a Ph.D. from the University of Texas at Austin. Before joining the faculty in the Fall of 1998, I held postdoctoral positions at the NEC Research Institute and Bell Labs. I was on leave during 2008, working at Yahoo! Research in Santa Clara, CA.
